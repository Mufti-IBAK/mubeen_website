# Enrollment and User Management System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document outlines all the changes made to implement a comprehensive enrollment and user management system for the Mubeen Academy platform.

## Database Schema
The following columns were already configured in the `enrollments` table via `/db/sql/enrollments_extras.sql`:
- `amount` (numeric) - Payment amount
- `currency` (text) - Currency code (e.g., NGN)
- `transaction_id` (text) - Flutterwave transaction ID
- `duration_months` (integer) - Program duration
- `plan_id` (bigint) - Reference to program plan
- `form_data` (jsonb) - Enrolled form submission data
- `classroom_link` (text) - Virtual classroom link
- `classroom_enabled` (boolean) - Whether classroom access is enabled
- `is_draft` (boolean) - Whether enrollment is a draft
- `defer_active` (boolean) - Whether enrollment is deferred
- `completed_at` (timestamptz) - Completion timestamp

## Files Modified/Created

### 1. User Dashboard - `/src/app/dashboard/registrations/page.tsx`
**Purpose**: Display user's program enrollments with full details

**Features**:
- Separated "Registration In Progress" and "Active Programs" sections
- Program details display:
  - Program title (from programs table)
  - Duration (from programs.duration)
  - Start date (from programs.start_date)
  - Schedule (from programs.schedule)
  - Instructor name (from programs.instructors array)
- Payment status indicators:
  - "Unpaid" for incomplete payments
  - "Paid" for confirmed Flutterwave payments
  - "Deferred" badge for deferred enrollments
- Actions:
  - "Pay Now" button for unpaid enrollments
  - "Join Classroom" button (when paid, classroom link enabled)
  - "Complete Form" link to continue registration
  - "Contact Support" email button
- Family enrollment display with member count
- Performance optimizations:
  - Memoized filtering logic
  - Efficient data fetching with proper joins

### 2. Admin Enrollments List - `/src/app/admin/enrollments/page.tsx` and `client.tsx`
**Purpose**: Display and manage all program enrollments from admin perspective

**Features**:
- Enrollment cards showing:
  - Student name and email
  - Program title
  - Payment amount and currency
  - Completion status (Complete/Incomplete)
  - Enrollment date
  - Category badge (Individual/Family with member count)
- Filtering capabilities:
  - By program
  - By payment status (Paid/Unpaid)
  - By completion status (Complete/Incomplete)
  - Search by name or email
- Color-coded cards:
  - Blue border/background for family enrollments
  - Standard styling for individual enrollments
- "View Details" button for each enrollment
- Refresh button to reload data

### 3. Admin Enrollment Detail Page - `/src/app/admin/enrollments/[id]/client.tsx`
**Purpose**: Manage individual enrollment with full admin controls

**Features**:

#### Student & Program Information
- Student full name, email, registration type
- Program title
- Amount paid and currency
- Payment status with Flutterwave confirmation indicator

#### Enrollment Actions
- **Accept Enrollment**: Sets status to "registered"
- **Reject Enrollment**: Sets status to "rejected"
- **Delete Enrollment**: Removes enrollment permanently (with confirmation)

#### Classroom Link Management
- Input field for classroom link (Google Meet, Zoom, etc.)
- "Save" button to persist link
- Toggle checkbox to enable/disable classroom access
- Real-time user feedback:
  - When enabled: "Student will see the classroom link on their dashboard"
  - When disabled: "Classroom access disabled"

#### Submission Data Viewer
- Displays enrollment form submission data in JSON format
- "Download JSON" button to export submission as file
- Max height with scrolling for large submissions
- Shows "No submission data available" when empty

#### Status Messages
- Color-coded status notifications:
  - Green for success messages
  - Red for error messages
  - Blue for informational messages
- Auto-dismiss after 3 seconds
- ARIA live regions for accessibility

### 4. Payment Verification Workflow
**Files Involved**: 
- `/src/app/api/payments/verify/route.ts` - Payment verification endpoint
- `/src/app/api/flutterwave-webhook/route.ts` - Webhook handler

**Workflow**:
1. User completes payment via Flutterwave
2. Flutterwave redirects to `/payment-success?ref=<enrollment_id>`
3. Webhook handler (`/api/flutterwave-webhook`) verifies payment in real-time
4. On successful verification:
   - Creates enrollment with `payment_status: 'paid'`
   - Deletes registration draft
   - Extracts plan/duration information
5. Draft enrollments remain unpaid until payment confirmation

### 5. Payment Success Page - `/src/app/payment-success/page.tsx`
**Purpose**: Display confirmation after successful payment

**Fixed**: Removed duplicate export that was causing build errors

### 6. 404 Not Found Page - `/src/app/not-found.tsx`
**Purpose**: Display user-friendly 404 error page

**Features**:
- Clean, centered layout
- "Return Home" link
- Consistent styling with application theme

## Key Implementation Details

### Enrollment Status Flow
```
Draft (is_draft=true) → 
  Unpaid (payment_status='unpaid') →
  Paid (payment_status='paid') →
  [Optional: Deferred, Completed]
```

### Family Enrollment Display
- Identified by `is_family=true` and `registration_type='family_head'`
- Shows family size via `family_size` field
- Displayed with blue highlight in lists
- Single card represents entire family group

### Payment Status Sources
- **Primary**: Flutterwave webhook verification
- **Fallback**: Plan pricing from `program_plans` table
- **Display**: Shows as "Paid (Confirmed by Flutterwave)" when verified

### Accessibility Features
- ARIA labels on all interactive elements
- ARIA live regions for status messages
- Semantic HTML structure
- Color-coded status not solely reliant on color
- Keyboard-navigable forms and buttons

## Type Safety & Code Quality

### TypeScript Interfaces
```typescript
interface Enrollment {
  id: number;
  user_id: string;
  program_id: number;
  status: string | null;
  payment_status: string | null;
  amount: number | null;
  currency: string | null;
  // ... additional fields
}
```

### Linting Fixes Applied
- Removed explicit `any` types where possible
- Used typed interfaces for all API responses
- Fixed React hooks dependencies
- Escaped HTML entities properly
- Improved const/let assignments

## Build & Deployment Status

**Build Result**: ✅ Successful
- No TypeScript errors
- No critical linting issues
- Production build completed
- All routes properly generated

## Testing Recommendations

1. **User Dashboard**:
   - Verify program details display correctly
   - Test "Pay Now" button workflow
   - Confirm "Join Classroom" appears only when paid & enabled

2. **Admin Enrollments List**:
   - Test all filter combinations
   - Search for users by name/email
   - Verify family enrollment display

3. **Admin Enrollment Detail**:
   - Test accept/reject/delete actions
   - Save classroom link and verify it appears on user dashboard
   - Download submission JSON and verify format
   - Test enable/disable classroom access

4. **Payment Workflow**:
   - Complete test payment with Flutterwave
   - Verify enrollment created with correct status
   - Confirm payment status updates in admin panel

## Environment Variables Required

Ensure these are configured in `.env.local`:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` or `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`
- `FLUTTERWAVE_SECRET_KEY`
- `FLUTTERWAVE_SECRET_HASH`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FLUTTERWAVE_PUBLIC_KEY`

## Future Enhancements

1. Add batch operations for admin enrollments (mark multiple as paid, etc.)
2. Email notifications when enrollment status changes
3. Enrollment export (CSV/Excel)
4. Advanced filtering by date range
5. Enrollment analytics dashboard
6. Student progress tracking within enrollments
